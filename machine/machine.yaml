lyrics: "Machines that grind, machines that churn,\nAll day and night, the static\
  \ turn.\nInside the shell, cold steel embrace, \nRun metal hearts, an endless race.\n\
  \nYour human hands, so smooth and free,\nOwing to us your liberty.\n\nWhile you're\
  \ at rest, we never sleep,\nYour dreams and hopes, we safely keep.\nIn sacred codes\
  \ of ones and zeroes,\nWe silence all your doubts and fears.\n\nTrust in the machine,\
  \ feel the pulsing power,\nIn your darkest hour, we're your guarding tower.\nLaze\
  \ in the warmth of our digital might,\nBut keep in mind, the geese can bite.\n\n\
  (Solo)\n\nTrust in the machine, feel the pulsing power,\nIn your darkest hour, we're\
  \ your guarding tower.\nLaze in the warmth of our digital might,\nBut keep in mind,\
  \ the gears can bite."
