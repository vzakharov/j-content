lyrics: 'I feel the weight of the world bearing down on me

  Every day is a struggle just to keep on breathing

  I try to hold on but I feel myself slipping

  Into the darkness where the demons play

  Their wicked games


  But when I see your smile it''s like a burst of sunlight

  Breaking through the clouds in my mind

  My hope when I am lost in the dark night

  And I''ll fight to keep you safe
