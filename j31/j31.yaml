lyrics: 'Feeling like I''m suffocating

  Trapped in my own mind

  Can''t escape the darkness

  That''s consuming me inside

  I try to find the light

  But it''s always just out of reach

  My thoughts are like a storm

  That''s raging deep inside of me


  I''m searching for a way out

  But it feels like there''s no doors


  I''m reaching for the stars

  But they keep slipping through my fingers

  I''m screaming for help

  But nobody hears my cries

  I''m trying to break free

  From this prison in my mind

  But the chains keep holding me down.'
