lyrics: "In the darkness, I've lost my way, \nIn the deafness, no words to say,\n\
  In the chaos, I stand alone,\nBearing burdens the world has thrown.\n\nEvery whisper\
  \ I'll never hear,\nEvery sorrow, every fear,\nIn the silence, I hide my pain,\n\
  In the thunder, I scream your name.\n\nOne last time\nAs the silence echoes through\
  \ the dark,\nLet me hear the beating of your heart.\nUnconfined\nBy the earthly\
  \ chains of space and time,\nLet our spirits intertwine,\nOne last time."
