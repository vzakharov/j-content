lyrics: 'Never in my life

  Thought I''d see the day

  When everyone I cared for

  Would just fade away


  One by one they fell

  Into the endless night

  And I now I''m left alone

  To face the fight


  What am I even fighting for

  In this alien world

  Am I the chosen one

  Or have I just been cursed?


  A savior or a sinner

  I can''t tell anymore

  One thing I know for sure

  This is not my war'
