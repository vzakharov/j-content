lyrics: 'Raise your horns and stomp your feet,

  A new adventure''s here to greet,

  Gather round, you rowdy lot,

  For the tune that time forgot.


  Tales of woe and battles won

  We''ll sing from dusk till morning sun.

  Here we go, our time has come!


  We''re back, we''re back, oh-oh-oh-oh,

  Sing it loud, let it echo-cho,

  We''re back, we''re back, we''re here to stay,

  Dance and drink the night away!


  Back, we''re back, hey-hey-hey-hey,

  Sing it proudly, let it sway,

  Back, we''re back, so don''t just stand,

  Dance and cheer throughout the land!'
