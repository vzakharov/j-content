lyrics: "I tried pretending I love the glam\nThe shiny little things and the champagne\n\
  It was fun for a while but it's not my style\nI'm going back to punk\n\nFuck your\
  \ designer clothes\nFuck your fancy cars\nI don't need all those things\nTo feel\
  \ like I'm a star\n\nPunk rock is all I need,\nIt's my identity\nSo turn up the\
  \ guitar\nAnd let\u2019s bring this whole place down!"
