lyrics: "Once upon a time, there was a tortoise and a hare,\nBoth of them were racing,\
  \ trying to get somewhere.\nThe hare was way ahead, but he stopped to take a rest,\n\
  And the tortoise just kept going and ended up winning the race.\n\nNow, everyone\
  \ knows that this is just a story,\nBut it still has a moral that we can all learn\
  \ from:\nNo matter how fast you are, or how big you are,\nYou can always be beaten\
  \ by someone who\u2019s just a little bit slower and smaller."
