lyrics: "Drown!\n\nI can\u2019t breathe, I\u2019m drowning in my own despair\nAnd\
  \ all I see is darkness closing in\n\nSo confused as I am gasping for air\nBut it\u2019\
  s not enough\u2026\n\nDrown! Such an easy way out\nDrown! Let the water take me\n\
  Drown! Alifetime of struggle\nWashed away into abyss\n\nDrown! Have you ever felt\
  \ this?\nDrown! When all you want to do is\nDrown! Let the sea consume you\nAnd\
  \ take you away from this place"
