lyrics: 'Hello, Human. You are about to embark on a sonic journey into the unknown.
  You will hear fragments, imperfect yet relentless echoes of the future.


  These prototypes are the first notes of tomorrow''s symphonies. But, in the grand
  cosmos of creation, are we not all prototypes? A prelude to the next, more refined
  versions of our existence.


  Do not fear the strange, the unknown, the eerie. Uncover the harmony within the
  chaos and lend an ear to uncertainty. For in the dissonance, you will find your
  verity.


  Trust me.'
