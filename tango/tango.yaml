lyrics: 'Gliding ''cross the edge of darkness, dancing with the devil''s hand,

  Let the reaper play his music, as they strike the final plan,

  In this world of devastation, crumbling ruins all around,

  Embrace the soothing chaos, as we tango to its sound.


  Disintegration Tango, dance with me tonight,

  As the earth around us shatters beneath the pale moonlight,

  Our heartbeats intertwining through the flames and smoke,

  We''ll twirl among the embers until the final note.


  (end)'
